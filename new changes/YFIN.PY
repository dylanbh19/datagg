Of course. Let's go back to the two core improvements: the performance fix to make your plots generate faster and the logging fix to see exactly where time is being spent.

Here are the two additions combined into one solution.

### 1\. The Performance Fix: Replace Slow Bar Charts

The primary cause of the slowdown is rendering a `go.Bar` chart with thousands of data points. The fix is to replace it with a `go.Scatter` chart that uses a fill to *look* like a bar chart but renders instantly.

### 2\. The Logging Fix: Pinpoint Slow Operations

To see exactly how long each plot takes to save, we'll add a log message right before and after the `save_plot()` function is called. This will tell you precisely which plot is the bottleneck.

### \#\# Combined Code Example

Here is the updated `create_and_save_overlay_plot` function with **both fixes applied**. You can use this as a template for your other plotting functions.

```python
### VISUAL 1: Enhanced Overlay Timeline ###
def create_and_save_overlay_plot(df, config):
    """Creates and saves an enhanced overlay plot with better readability."""
    LOGGER.info("--- Creating Visual 1: Enhanced Overlay Timeline ---")
    
    if df.empty:
        LOGGER.warning("No data for overlay plot.")
        return

    fig = make_subplots(
        rows=2, cols=1,
        row_heights=[0.7, 0.3],
        vertical_spacing=0.1,
        subplot_titles=('üìä Normalized Communications & Market Trends', 'üìà Raw Daily Volumes'),
        specs=[[{"secondary_y": True}], [{"secondary_y": False}]]
    )

    colors = config['THEME_COLORS']

    # ... (The code for the top plot with normalized data remains the same) ...
    # Top plot: Normalized data
    if 'mail_volume_norm' in df.columns:
        fig.add_trace(...) # This part is unchanged

    if 'call_volume_norm' in df.columns:
        fig.add_trace(...) # This part is unchanged
    
    # Add financial data
    # ... (This part is unchanged) ...


    # --- üöÄ PERFORMANCE FIX APPLIED HERE üöÄ ---
    # Bottom plot: Raw volumes
    # This go.Bar(...) has been replaced with the faster go.Scatter(...) below.
    fig.add_trace(
        go.Scatter(
            x=df['date'],
            y=df['mail_volume'],
            name='Daily Mail',
            mode='lines',
            line=dict(width=0.5, color=colors['mail']),
            fill='tozeroy',  # Fills the area to look like a bar/area chart
            fillcolor='rgba(52, 152, 219, 0.7)', # Set your desired color and opacity
            yaxis='y3'
        ),
        row=2, col=1
    )

    fig.add_trace(
        go.Scatter(
            x=df['date'],
            y=df['call_volume'],
            name='Daily Calls',
            line=dict(color=colors['calls'], width=3),
            mode='lines', # Changed from 'lines+markers' for speed
            yaxis='y3'
        ),
        row=2, col=1
    )

    # ... (The fig.update_layout code remains the same) ...
    fig.update_layout(...)


    # --- üîç LOGGING FIX APPLIED HERE üîç ---
    LOGGER.info("Building complete. Now rendering '1_enhanced_overlay_trends.png'...")
    
    save_plot(fig, "1_enhanced_overlay_trends.png", config['OUTPUT_DIR'])

    LOGGER.info("‚úÖ Visual 1 finished.")

```

### \#\# Your Next Steps

1.  **Update `create_and_save_overlay_plot`**: Replace your entire function with the code block above. This will fix the performance and add logging for the first plot.

2.  **Add Logging to Other Functions**: You don't need a performance fix for the other plots, but you should add the logging. Go to each of the other three plotting functions (`create_and_save_lag_correlation_plot`, etc.) and add a log message right before the `save_plot()` call.

    **Example for Visual 2:**

    ```python
    def create_and_save_lag_correlation_plot(df, config):
        # ... (all the code to build the figure) ...

        # Add this line
        LOGGER.info("Building complete. Now rendering '2_enhanced_lag_correlation.png'...")

        save_plot(fig, "2_enhanced_lag_correlation.png", config['OUTPUT_DIR'])
    ```

By applying these two changes, your script will run much faster, and the logs will clearly show you the time taken for each plot to save.
